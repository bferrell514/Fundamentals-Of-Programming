# CSCFundamentalsOfProgramming
​Language enables thought. In this course I study a class of formal  languages known as programming languages. Similar to natural languages, these formal languages enable us to reason about algorithms and procedures to solve  computational problems on computers. However, their formal nature restricts the  kind of meanings particular language constructs can assume and therefore makes  them amenable for the execution on a computer. 

Throughout this course we will be using various programming language and software development environments including: ML, Java, and Prolog.
